# usbNESController
NES controller to USB gamepad with Arduino Leonardo

Converts the output of 2 NES controllers into USB HID input 
so that the controllers become recognized as two seperate gamepads by computers.

Tested on windows, and PS3

Latch and clock pins are common between the controllers to ensure all button states are captured simultaniously.
